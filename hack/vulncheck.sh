# govulncheck gate: binary mode + an explicit, expiring allowlist of advisory
# IDs. Run by `make vuln` and by the `vuln` CI job, so the gate is identical in
# both places.
#
# Why binary mode: it scans what is actually compiled into the shipped binary
# (upgradescope, the one binary behind scan/agent/serve), built for
# linux/amd64 like the image, and avoids source-version skew.
#
# What fails the gate:
#   - any symbol-level finding (the set govulncheck's text output reports as
#     "Your code is affected by ...") that is not listed in
#     hack/vuln-allowlist.txt, stdlib included;
#   - an allowlisted finding in a different module than its entry names;
#   - an allowlisted finding whose entry has expired;
#   - an allowlisted finding that now has a fixed version on its module, so
#     the fix is one `go get` away;
#   - govulncheck itself failing, or printing anything other than a complete
#     govulncheck JSON stream. The gate fails closed: a scan that did not run
#     is never reported as a clean scan.
# Module- and package-level findings (vulnerable code linked in but never
# called) are printed as a count and do not fail the build.
#
# Exit status: 0 pass, 1 findings, 2 the scan or the allowlist is broken.
#
# Knobs, mostly for hack/vulncheck_test.sh:
#   GOVULNCHECK_VERSION           scanner version to install (pinned below)
#   GOVULNCHECK                   use this govulncheck binary instead of installing
#   UPGRADESCOPE_VULN_ALLOWLIST   allowlist file (default hack/vuln-allowlist.txt)
#   UPGRADESCOPE_VULN_BINS        space-separated binaries to scan instead of building
#   UPGRADESCOPE_VULN_TODAY       YYYY-MM-DD to evaluate expiry against (default: today, UTC)
